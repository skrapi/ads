# ADS: Algorithms and Data Structures

I need to learn these concepts and so I thought it would be fun to create a little multichoice questionnaire that runs in the terminal.


## Goals

* Learn more Rust
* Learn some Algorithms
* Learn some Data Structures

SMART
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. 

## Data Structures
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Binary Trees
- [ ] n-ary Trees

## Algorithms
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Binary Search


## Control Flow

Inputs: Stdin
Outputs: Stdout

States: Greeting, Test Selection, Testing, Results, Exit

Each state needs to handle the input `Key` and output a `String` to write to output

Each state also needs a state entry, state runtime and state exit
